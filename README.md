# Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
## Overview

The rapid growth of data collection has ushered in a new era of information processing. Recommendation systems have become integral in leveraging this vast amount of data to create more efficient systems. In this project, we aim to build a baseline movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. This system will employ information filtering techniques to enhance the quality of search results and provide users with movie recommendations that are relevant to their preferences and search history.

## Dataset

The TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset is utilized for this project. This dataset contains metadata on over 5000 movies, including information such as movie titles, genres, cast, crew, ratings, and user reviews. The dataset is rich in features, allowing for comprehensive analysis and recommendation generation.

## Methodology

The recommendation system is developed using collaborative filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering leverages user behavior and preferences to recommend items. In this project, we implement collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user-item interactions and generate movie recommendations based on similarities between users or items.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The following steps outline the implementation process:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into movie attributes and user preferences.
Model Development: Building collaborative filtering models to generate movie recommendations.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the recommendation system using relevant metrics such as accuracy and coverage.
Deployment: Deploying the recommendation system for real-world usage.
